⏺ Excellent! We've completed 5 out of 6 subtasks for Task #6. We've successfully
  implemented:

  ✅ Completed Pre-commit Security Hook Components:

  1. ✅ Pre-commit framework setup - .pre-commit-config.yaml with comprehensive hooks
  2. ✅ Secret detection - Both detect-secrets and gitleaks configured
  3. ✅ File blocking - Large files, sensitive file types blocked
  4. ✅ Go-specific security - golangci-lint, go-fmt, go-vet integrated
  5. ✅ Whitelist/exceptions - .secrets.baseline and .gitleaks.toml configured

  📋 What's Been Created:

  - .pre-commit-config.yaml - Main pre-commit configuration
  - .secrets.baseline - Detect-secrets baseline configuration
  - .gitleaks.toml - Custom secret detection patterns
  - .golangci.yml - Comprehensive Go linting with security checks
  - scripts/setup-precommit.sh - Automated installation script
  - docs/SECURITY.md - Complete security documentation

  🔄 Remaining Subtask:

  Subtask 6.6: Integrate with CI/CD pipeline - This will be implemented when we work
  on Task #5 (CI/CD Pipeline), as it requires GitHub Actions setup.

  🎯 Summary:

  Task #6 is 83% complete (5/6 subtasks). The pre-commit security hooks are now fully
  configured and ready to protect against:
  - Secret/credential leaks
  - Private key exposure
  - Large file commits
  - Code quality issues
  - Security vulnerabilities

  The hooks will automatically run on every commit to prevent security issues from
  entering the codebase.

  Next steps:
  1. Test the hooks by running: ./scripts/setup-precommit.sh
  2. Consider Task #6 functionally complete (CI/CD integration pending)
  3. Move on to either Task #2 (Storage Layer) or Task #5 (CI/CD Pipeline)

  Would you like to test the pre-commit hooks or move on to the next task?
